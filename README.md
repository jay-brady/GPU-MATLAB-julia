# GPU-MATLAB-julia

This simple batch of code uses two files to generate a julia fractal image and then read and display that image.

julia.cu houses the CUDA code that generates the image. Most of this code was taken from 'CUDA by Example' by Jason Sanders + Edward Kandrot.

read_image.m is a MATLAB script that reads in the file generated by the julia program and displays the image.

To compile just call 'make'

(The image file created is not any standard format. It is just RGBA data (as unsigned char). The image created is 1000x1000 pixels)
